The GuideDog application is installed on a GPS and WiFi enabled Mobile Phone. A GPS  subsystem on the phone acquires longitude and latitude coordinates from a satellite. The application then extracts this location information and transfers it via Wireless LAN to the server. The information is processed and the route is calculated to a destination whose coordinates are known. The processed route information is then sent back to the mobile application where it is translated into audio commands for the user. Data is continuously sent to and from the server so that the route information is consistently updated.
